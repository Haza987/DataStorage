I have used GitHub Copilot in this project to assist me.
I have made comments throughout where it has helped me and I have done my best to note what each change does.
I have also used GitHub Copilot to help me fix errors that I was having trouble with to come with simple solutions.
I tried not to use any solution that was too complicated or that I could not fully understand.

I hope you enjoy my project!
